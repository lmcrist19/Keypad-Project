# Keypad Project

## Description

This Arduino project implements a keypad-based lock system. When the correct code is entered on the keypad, it unlocks a door by lighting a green LED. An incorrect code triggers a red LED to indicate an invalid entry. This project can be used to understand and experiment with basic security systems using a keypad and LEDs.
